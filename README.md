Announcing My LLM Project: Revolutionising Equity Research with AI

Tired of sifting through endless news articles for that next big investment opportunity?  This is where my exciting LLM project comes in!

What is it?

I've built a cutting-edge tool that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline equity research analysis. It combines LangChain, OpenAI, and Streamlit to create a news research tool and chatbot specifically designed for the financial world.

How will it help you?

Boost Efficiency: Save precious time by letting the chatbot analyze news articles and extract relevant insights.

Informed Decisions: Build a comprehensive knowledge base of information to support your investment strategies.

Cost-Effectiveness: Optimize text processing to minimize API usage and keep costs down.

Precision Search: Utilize semantic search to pinpoint the most valuable information within articles.

Rapid Development: Streamlit allows for quick and easy project development, ideal for both short-term and long-term exploration.

This project paves the way for:

Enhanced research processes for analysts and investors.

Data-driven investment decisions based on aggregated insights.

Democratising access to powerful research tools for a wider audience.
